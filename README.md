# HealthCare-Assignment
# Context
>  Medical research university X is undergoing a deep research on patients with certain conditions.  University has an internal AI team. 
Due to confidentiality the patientâ€™s details and the conditions are masked by  the client by providing different datasets to the AI team for 
developing a AIML model which can predict the  condition of the patient depending on the received test results.

##  PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
-  To Demonstrate the ability to fetch, process and leverage data to generate useful predictions  by training Supervised 
Learning algorithms. 



## Conclusions
- Training accuracy has gone up by 10%.
- Testing Precision and recall values of type_h have gone up by 4% by compromising 'type_s' and 'normal'.



## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- python
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- stats model
